Welcome to Rainbow Snake!

This game uses incursus so you'll need to run it inside your terminal.

The objective of this game is to survive as long as you can and eat as many apples and dollar bills as you can!

Use the arrow keys or numpad to move in the up, down, left, and right directions. Don't run into the walls or yourself though! Goodluck and try to get a high score! Enjoy your time in Rainbow Snake!

Compile the program by typing "make" into the terminal.
Run it with "./snake"

You can remove the binaries with "make clean"
